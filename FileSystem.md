# fs Module 

fs is a file System Module in node js used to read, create , write , update any type of text file. And we have some other methods to handle directory as well. It has two type of methods synchronous and asynchronous. We use Asynchronous for large data files because it , blocks the other functionality of the server and synchronous methods are required to handle the required task. 
We also have some other methods in node js like stream to stream a large file by dividing it into smaller chunks. 
We have some other methods used for the same functionality like reading-zipping-streeming this method creates a pipeline to strem the data to the frontend by efficiently using the server serources efficiently.
